  This line means, use default.hbs layout from src/html/layouts/

{{!< default1}}

<!-- 
  Put some content into an .hbs file inside of /partials, 
  and you can just throw it in anywhere!

  If you want to use something exported from ai2html...
    1. Rename the exported .html file to .hbs
    2. Put the .hbs file inside of 'html/story'
    3. Move the exported images to the images folder
    4. Include the partial normally like below
  -->

<!--
  You can also put the actual HTML here if you really want to,
  although it's a little less organized looking
-->

{{!-- <div class="story-body">
    <h2>Here is some body copy</h2>
    <p>I can put code in <code>src/index.hbs</code> directly, but it's nicer to put it in a partial.</p>
